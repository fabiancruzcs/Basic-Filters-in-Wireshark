# Using Basic Filters in Wireshark - Lab

In this lab, I used Wireshark on Ubuntu Server 20.04 to analyze network traffic. I learned how to apply basic filters, understand Wireshark's color codes, and distinguish between key data and background noise, gaining hands-on experience with packet analysis.
